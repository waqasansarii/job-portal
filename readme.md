- Virtual environment tool (e.g., `virtualenv`)
- Up-to-date `pip` (`python -m pip install --upgrade pip`)

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

---

## Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# For Windows:

source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Step 3: Install Required Libraries

Install the dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 4: Configure the Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<your_email_host_password>
DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_USER=<your_email_host_user>
CLOUDINARY_API=<your_cloudinary_api_key>
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=<your_cloudinary_secret>
```

> **Note:** Ensure the `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to version control.

---

## Step 5: Initial Project Setup
